 How to Create a Declaration File (abcd.d.ts)?

 A declaration file in TypeScript (with the .d.ts extension) is used to describe the types of JavaScript libraries, allowing you to safely use them in a TypeScript project. These files contain type annotations for existing JavaScript code that doesn't have its types defined.


Steps to Create and Use a Declaration File:

--- step 1

Create the Declaration File: Suppose you have a file called utils.js and you want to declare its types in a file called utils.d.ts.

// utils.d.ts
declare function add(a: number, b: number): number;
declare function subtract(a: number, b: number): number;

----- step 2

Use the Declaration File: You can then import and use these declared types in your TypeScript file.

// index.ts
import { add, subtract } from './utils';

const result1 = add(5, 3);
const result2 = subtract(10, 2);
