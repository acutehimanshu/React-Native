when we write console.log before super()
then this console will print before calling the super 
becuase that condole.log has nothing to do with object

But when you will perform any action in the super before then it will generatore error
eg: Super must called before accessing this in the constructor for the derived class. 



When we are goind method overloading
then it should be parameter compatable 
means return type may change but parameter must be the same. 
that terms is called Assignable.
